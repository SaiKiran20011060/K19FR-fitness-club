<h1><b>K19FR FITNESS CLUB</h1>
<h2>What is FITNESS?</h2>
<p>According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), physical fitness 
is defined as 'the ability to carry out daily tasks with vigor and alertness, without 
undue fatigue, and with ample energy to enjoy leisure-time pursuits and respond to 
emergencies.' Based on this definition, fitness involves everything from getting out of 
bed to hiking to performing CPR.
<br>
In order to complete all of these tasks, one must consistently address their fitness levels.
This requires proper conditioning through both structured exercise and leisurely activities.

<h3>Components of FITNESS<h3>
<p><i><b>Cardiorespiratory endurance -</b> typically measured by how long or fast a person can perform
an activity and how this impacts measurements such as heart rate and oxygen consumption.
<br> <br>
Muscular endurance - typically measured by how many repetitions of an exercise a person can
perform. Common tests involve push-ups and sit ups.
<br> <br>
Muscular strength - typically measured by how much weight can be moved in relation to 
repetitions. Exercises involving multiple joints and muscle groups such as squats or bench 
press are often used.
<br> <br>
Muscular power - typically measured by how much force can be generated during a given 
activity. Advanced equipment used by biomechanists are often needed to measure muscular 
power.

<p>Flexibility - typically measured by how far a muscle group can be stretched or joint can 
be moved. The most common tests involve the hamstrings and shoulders.
<br> <br>
Balance - typically measured by how long a particular position can be held with or without 
some type of activity being performed. Simple tests such as standing on one leg can be used 
to assess balance. More advanced tests may involve standing on an unsteady object while 
trying to catch a ball.
<br> <br>
Speed - typically measured by how quickly an individual can move from one point to another. 
The 40-yard dash is often used to assess speed.
