<h1>DIET FOOD</h1>

<h2><t>1)Start with whole-grain cereal.</t><h2>

<p>If you don’t have enough to eat before you exercise, you may not have enough gas in the 
tank. You might burn fewer calories, too. Have some healthy carbs at least an hour in 
advance of your workout.

Try a bowl of whole-grain cereal with skim milk or some whole wheat toast or a bagel. Skip 
the cream cheese and butter. Saturated fats take longer to digest and can affect the amount 
of oxygen your blood delivers to your muscles.
</p>

<h3>2)Grab a banana<h3>

<p>Don’t have much time before you head to the gym? Eat an apple or a banana 5 or 10 minutes 
before your workout for some quick, natural energy.
<br>
Your body easily digests these carbohydrates and turns them into the energy you need for 
exercise. Also, fruit is packed with helpful nutrients.

<h4>3)Grilled chicken at mealtime.</h4>

<p>When you exercise regularly, you need more protein than people who don’t, especially 
after a workout. Your body uses it to repair muscles, to make blood cells, and for many 
other purposes. For lunch or dinner, serve a leaner source, like grilled chicken or turkey, 
instead of something like a cheeseburger.

<h5>4)A bowl of berries.</h5>

<p>After a workout, go for these instead of a bottle of juice. A lot of the fiber in whole 
fruits is lost as they become juice.

Blueberries, in particular, have been shown to reduce muscle soreness from strenuous 
exercise. Cherries are another good option. But any berry will likely help.

<h6>5)Water or a sports drink.</h6>

<p>Hydration is a must when you exercise. Often, water is all you need. But it depends on 
what you are doing. If your activity is less than 60 minutes, sip small amounts of water 
often to replace lost fluids. But when your workout is intense and lasts longer than an 
hour, a sports drink could help your hydration and your performance. Just keep an eye on 
the calories and sugar, like with any other drink, especially if you want to lose weight.
